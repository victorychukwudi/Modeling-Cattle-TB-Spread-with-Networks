# Modeling-Cattle-TB-Spread-with-Networks
This project extends a cattle TB transmission model by adding trade networks (farm-to-farm cattle movements) and neighborhood networks (geographic or trading links). These additions create a more realistic view of TB spread, helping identify key pathways and risks in cattle populations.
